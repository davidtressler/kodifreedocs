<h2> How to install from a ZIP file </h2>

Install from zip file allows you to install add-ons or repositories which may not be available in the Kodi add-on repository. To install a add-on or repository from a zip file you will need to enable Unknown Source from Settings/System/Add-ons. This can be done at the time of installation.

Note: By enabling Unknown Sources, Add-ons will be given access to your personal data stored on your device. By allowing, you agree that you are solely responsible for any loss of data, unwanted behavior, or damage to your device.

To access the Add-on browser see: How to access the Add-on browser or How to access the Add-on manager

    Step 1: Select Install from zip file

    Step 2: If you have not enabled Unknown Sources, you will notified that it is disabled.
    If you wish to enable select Settings, if you do not wish to enable select OK. 
    If you have already enabled Unknown sources skip to Step 6'.

    Step 3: When you select Settings you will be taken to the Add-ons settings window.
    Enable Unknow sources if you wish to install your add-on or repository from a zip file.

    Step 4: After you enable Unknown sources you will be presented with a Warning.
    Make sure you read and understand this warning, then select Yes if you wish to proceed.

    Step 5: If you have selected Yes and enabled Unknown sources you can then navigate back to the Add-on browser and once again select Install from zip file

    Step 6: You will now be presented with a browser window where you can navigate to where your zip file is stored. 
    Your zip file can be stored anywhere your device has access to and can be either on local storage or a network share.

    Step 7: Once you have navigated to the zip file you want installed, select it then select OK. 
    After your add-on and any dependencies have finished installing you will be able to use it.
    Note: If you have issues with the add-on installing or after installing it does not work as intended, you will need to contact the Add-on Author.
